  User selects a town and is shown a list of breweries.
  User can then select that brewery and is shown info about that brewery
  Grab the list of Breweries from http://coloradofrontrange.com/
  Print out a list of the Breweries based on the towns that they select
  Offer the user the chance to select a certain brewery
  Offer them a current menu of their beer
  Maybe print out a description of each beer - we will see
